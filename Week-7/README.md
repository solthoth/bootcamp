# WEEK 7: Incident Response and Forensics
The 90's called, they want their datacenter back. The Cloud is not the datacenter, and so we must reinvent forensics for the Cloud. We do not have direct access to hosts and network, but we do have the tools at our disposal to perform forensics.

## OBJECTIVES
- Incident Response on the Cloud
- Cloud Forensics

# Lesson 1: Gathering Forensic Data

# Lesson 2: Capturing Forensic Images

# Lesson 3: Performing Basic Forensics
