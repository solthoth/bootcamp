# WEEK 5: Building A Rugged App
Building rugged and secure applications is not trivial. Software Engineers and DevOps Engineers are responsible, not only for their code base, but for their Infrastructure as well. Cloud Service Providers offer a suite of services and patterns, but it is up to the developers and engineers to understand how to leverage these patterns and services to optimize for security.
