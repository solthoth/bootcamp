# WEEK 8: The Capstone Project
Now that we've accomplished two rounds of DevSecOps and improved our skills significantly, it's time to build something that helps solve a problem.

## OBJECTIVES
- Define a Problem to solve
- Build a Plan of Action (Craws/Walk/Run)


## ASSIGNMENTS
- [Required] Pick a pain-point/problem you faced in DevSecOps Bootcamp and solve it. For example:
  - A command-line tool to further automate cloud deployments.

This assignment is required for Week 9.  

Each participant must present a 3-5 minute recorded demo briefly describing the problem, the solution, how the solution works, and any potential iterative improvements to the solution.
